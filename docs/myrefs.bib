Indeed, serious diagnostic errors can appear when observing images through everyday monitors. Typically, these occur whenever professionals are ill-positioned with respect to the display or visualize images under improper light and luminance conditions. In this work, we show that virtual reality can assist radiodiagnostics by considerably diminishing or cancel out the effects of unsuitable ambient conditions. Our approach combines immersive head-mounted displays with interactive surfaces to support professional radiologists in analyzing medical images and formulating diagnostics. We evaluated our prototype with two senior medical doctors and four seasoned radiology fellows. Results indicate that our approach constitutes a viable, flexible, portable and cost-efficient option to traditional radiology reading rooms.},

	abstract = {Interactions within virtual environments often require manipulating 3D virtual objects. To this end, researchers have endeavoured to find efficient solutions using either traditional input devices or focusing on different input modalities, such as touch and mid‐air gestures. Different virtual environments and diverse input modalities present specific issues to control object position, orientation and scaling: traditional mouse input, for example, presents non‐trivial challenges because of the need to map between 2D input and 3D actions. While interactive surfaces enable more natural approaches, they still require smart mappings. Mid‐air gestures can be exploited to offer natural manipulations mimicking interactions with physical objects. However, these approaches often lack precision and control. All these issues and many others have been addressed in a large body of work. In this article, we survey the state‐of‐the‐art in 3D object manipulation, ranging from traditional desktop approaches to touch and mid‐air interfaces, to interact in diverse virtual environments. We propose a new taxonomy to better classify manipulation properties. Using our taxonomy, we discuss the techniques presented in the surveyed literature, highlighting trends, guidelines and open challenges, that can be useful both to future research and to developers of 3D user interfaces.},

In an initial user study we have proved the applicability of the metaphor for some common tasks, and we have found that compared to in-air 3D interaction techniques the users performed up to 28\% more precisely using about the same amount of time.},

	abstract = {Research on 3D interaction has explored the application of multi-touch technologies to 3D stereoscopic displays. However, the ability to perceive 3D objects at different depths (in front or behind the screen surface) conflicts with the necessity of expressing inputs on the screen surface. Touching the screen increases the risk of causing the vergence-accommodation conflict which can lead to the loss of the stereoscopic effect or cause discomfort.
In this work, we present two studies evaluating a novel approach based on the concept of indirect touch interaction via an external multi-touch device. We compare indirect touch techniques to two state-of-the-art 3D interaction techniques: DS3 and the Triangle Cursor. The first study offers a quantitative and qualitative study of direct and indirect interaction on a 4 DOF docking task. The second presents a follow-up experiment focusing on a 6 DOF docking task. Results show that indirect touch interaction techniques provide a more comfortable viewing experience than both techniques. It also shows that there are no drawbacks when switching to indirect touch, as their performances in terms of net manipulation times are comparable.},

The combination of multi-touch input and stereoscopic projection usually requires an indirect technique to interact with objects above the tabletop, as touches can only be detected on the surface. Triangle Cursor is a 3D interaction technique that allows specification of a 3D position and yaw rotation above the interactive tabletop. It was designed to avoid occlusions that disturb the stereoscopic perception. While Triangle Cursor uses an indirect approach, the position, the height above the surface and the yaw rotation can be controlled simultaneously, resulting in a 4 DOF manipulation technique. We have evaluated Triangle Cursor in an initial user study and compared it to a related existing technique in a formal user study. Our experiments show that users were able to perform all tasks significantly faster with our technique without loosing any precision. Most of the subjects considered the technique easy to use and satisfying.},

We have evaluated balloon selection in a formal user study that compared it to two well-known interaction techniques for selecting a static 3D target: a 3DOF tracked wand and keyboard cursor keys. We found that balloon selection was significantly faster than using cursor keys and had a significantly lower error rate than the wand. The lower error rate appeared to result from the user's hands being supported by the tabletop surface, resulting in significantly reduced hand tremor and arm fatigue.},

	abstract = {Immersive virtual environments (VEs) have the potential to offer rich three-dimensional interaction to users. In many instances, however, 3D interaction tasks are difficult due to both the imprecision of tracking devices and the inability of users to achieve and maintain precise hand positions in 3D space. One way to improve upon existing interaction techniques is to dynamically change the sensitivity of the interaction technique based on user input. Previous research has applied this principle to virtual hand-based manipulation techniques; when the user slows down the movement of her physical hand, the virtual hand slows down even more to allow precise manipulation. In this study we extend the prior research by applying the velocity-based scaling principle to HOMER, an existing at-a-distance manipulation technique based on ray-casting. The scaled HOMER technique offers the user the freedom to accomplish both long- and short-distance manipulation tasks with higher levels of precision without compromising speed. We present results from a user study that shows that the addition of scaling to HOMER significantly improves user performance on 3D manipulation tasks.},

Previous studies have separately examined the benefits of these three interaction attributes over mouse-based interactions. In contrast, we present an empirical user study that considers these three interaction attributes together for a single task, such that we can quantify and compare the performances of each attribute. In our experiment users select multiple targets using either a mouse-based workstation equipped with one mouse, or a multitouch workstation using either one finger, two fingers (one from each hand), or multiple fingers. We find that the fastest multitouch condition is about twice as fast as the mouse-based workstation, independent of the number of targets. Direct-touch with one finger accounts for an average of 83\% of the reduction in selection time. Bimanual interaction, using at least two fingers, one on each hand, accounts for the remaining reduction in selection time. Further, we find that for novice multitouch users there is no significant difference in selection time between using one finger on each hand and using any number of fingers for this task. Based on these observations we conclude with several design guidelines for developing multitouch user interfaces.},

In a controlled experiment, we compare DS3 with Sticky Tools and Screen-Space.

However, while effec- tive and informative for organization, this use of the third dimension does not usually extend far above the table. To enrich interaction with digital tables, we present the concept of shallow-depth 3D - D interaction with limited depth. Within this shallow-depth D environment several common interaction methods need to be reconsidered. Starting from any of one, two and three touch points, we present inter- action techniques that provide control of all types of 3D rotation coupled with translation (6DOF) on a direct-touch tabletop display. The different techniques exemplify a wide range of interaction possibilities: from the one-touch tech- nique, which is designed to be simple and natural, but in- herits a degree of imprecision from its simplicity; through to three-touch interaction, which allows precise bimanual si- multaneous control of multiple degrees of freedom, but at the cost of simplicity. To understand how these techniques support interaction in shallow-depth 3D, we present a user study that examines the efficiency of, and preferences for, the techniques developed. Results show that users are fastest and most accurate when using the three-touch technique and that their preferences were also strongly in favour of the ex- pressive power available from three-touch.},

We introduce an interaction paradigm that has the benefits of force-based interaction complete with full 6DOF manipulation. Only multi-touch input, such as that provided by the Microsoft Surface and the SMART Table, is necessary to achieve this interaction freedom. This paradigm is realized through sticky tools: a combination of sticky fingers, a physically familiar technique for moving, spinning, and lifting virtual objects; opposable thumbs, a method for flipping objects over; and virtual tools, a method for propagating behaviour to other virtual objects in the scene. We show how sticky tools can introduce richer meaning to tabletop computing by drawing a parallel between sticky tools and the discussion in Urp [20] around the meaning of tangible devices in terms of nouns, verbs, reconfigurable tools, attributes, and pure objects. We then relate this discussion to other force-based interaction techniques by describing how a designer can introduce complexity in how people can control both physical and virtual objects, how physical objects can control both physical and virtual objects, and how virtual objects can control virtual objects.},

The literature on this topic currently shows diverging arguments for what enables effective and/or intuitive interaction. We argue that the limiting problem is the projection from 3D to 2D in input and output; and in particular how transformations in 3D are mapped to the interaction surface. Not only does this argument explain the divergence in the literature -- it also leads to improved interaction metaphors, similar but not identical to widgets in other 3D interaction domains. We show in a controlled experiment that adapted interaction widgets are significantly superior to other approaches in the context of multi-touch interaction.},

Our manipulation technique permits using the non-dominant hand to specify the manipulation reference while the dominant hand is used to determine the operation mode and control the transformation. In addition to 3D manipulation, TouchSketch provides also a set of functions to edit the shape of 3D objects. Users can use this application to accomplish rapid sketching tasks. We have conducted a user study to evaluate the efficiency of our manipulation technique.

Because the use of RST has thus far focused almost entirely on 2D, there are not yet standard techniques for extending these principles into three dimensions. In this paper we describe a screen-space method which fully captures the semantics of the traditional 2D RST multi-touch interaction, but also allows us to extend these same principles into three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Just like RST allows users to directly manipulate 2D contexts with two or more points, our method allows the user to directly manipulate 3D objects with three or more points. We show some novel interactions, which take perspective into account and are thus not available in orthographic environments. Furthermore, we identify key ambiguities and unexpected behaviors that arise when performing direct manipulation in 3D and offer solutions to mitigate the difficulties each presents. Finally, we show how to extend our method to meet application-specific control objectives, as well as show our method working in some example environments.},

	abstract = {Multitouch input devices afford effective solutions for 6DOF (six Degrees of Freedom) manipulation of 3D objects. Mainly focusing on large-size multitouch screens, existing solutions typically require at least three fingers and bimanual interaction for full 6DOF manipulation. However, single-hand, two-finger operations are preferred especially for portable multitouch devices (e.g., popular smartphones) to cause less hand occlusion and relieve the other hand for necessary tasks like holding the devices. Our key idea for full 6DOF control using only two contact fingers is to introduce two manipulation modes and two corresponding gestures by examining the moving characteristics of the two fingers, instead of the number of fingers or the directness of individual fingers as done in previous works. We solve the resulting binary classification problem using a learning-based approach. Our pilot experiment shows that with only two contact fingers and typically unimanual interaction, our technique is comparable to or even better than the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Since traditional transformation widgets have been mainly designed for mouse-based systems, they are not user friendly for multitouch screens. There is little research on how to use the extra input bandwidth of multitouch screens to ease constrained transformation of 3D objects. This paper presents a small set of multitouch gestures which offers a seamless control of manipulation constraints (i.e., axis or plane) and modes (i.e., translation, rotation or scaling). Our technique does not require any complex manipulation widgets but candidate axes, which are for visualization rather than direct manipulation. Such design not only minimizes visual clutter but also tolerates imprecise touch-based inputs. To further expand our axis-based interaction vocabulary, we introduce intuitive touch gestures for relative manipulations, including snapping and borrowing axes of another object. A preliminary evaluation shows that our technique is more effective than a direct adaption of standard transformation widgets to the tactile paradigm. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The statistical results showed that the completion time in the approach phase of the 7-Handle technique was significantly longer than the completion time of the 6-DOF technique. Nevertheless, we found a significant interaction effect between the two factors (the manipulation technique and the object size) on the completion time of the refinement phase. In addition, even though we did not find any significant differences between the two techniques in terms of intuitiveness, ease of use and global preference in the result of subjective data, we obtained a significantly better satisfaction feedback from the subjects for the efficiency and fatigue criteria.},

In this paper we present a technique for users to seamlessly switch between interacting on the tabletop surface to above it. Our aim is to leverage the space above the surface in combination with the regular tabletop display to allow more intuitive manipulation of digital content in three-dimensions. Our goal is to design a technique that closely resembles the ways we manipulate physical objects in the real-world; conceptually, allowing virtual objects to be 'picked up' off the tabletop surface in order to manipulate their three dimensional position or orientation. We chart the evolution of this technique, implemented on two rear projection-vision tabletops. Both use special projection screen materials to allow sensing at significant depths beyond the display. Existing and new computer vision techniques are used to sense hand gestures and postures above the tabletop, which can be used alongside more familiar multi-touch interactions. Interacting above the surface in this way opens up many interesting challenges. In particular it breaks the direct interaction metaphor that most tabletops afford. We present a novel shadow-based technique to help alleviate this issue. We discuss the strengths and limitations of our technique based on our own observations and initial user feedback, and provide various insights from comparing, and contrasting, our tabletop implementations},

While allowing virtual objects to coexist with user actions in the physical world, interaction with these virtual objects above the surface presents interesting challenges. In this paper, we aim to understand which approaches to 3D virtual object manipulations are suited to this scenario. To this end, we implemented five different techniques based on the literature. Four are mid-air techniques, while the remainder relies on multi-touch gestures, which act as a baseline. Our setup combines affordable non-intrusive tracking technologies with a multi-touch stereo tabletop, providing head and hands tracking, to improve both depth perception and seamless interactions above the table. We conducted a user evaluation to find out which technique appealed most to participants. Results suggest that mid-air interactions, combining direct manipulation with six degrees of freedom for the dominant hand, are both more satisfying and efficient than the alternatives tested.},

Nowadays, the Kinect sensor has turned mid-air interaction into another affordable and popular way of interacting. Mid-air interaction enables the possibility of interacting remotely without any physical contact and in a more natural manner. Nonetheless, although some scattered manipulation techniques have been proposed for mid-air interaction, there is a lack of evaluations and comparisons that hinders the selection and development of these techniques. To solve this issue, we gathered four design choices that can be used to classify mid-air manipulation techniques. Namely, choices are based on the required number of hands, separation of translation–rotation, decomposition of rotation, and interaction metaphors. Furthermore, we developed, adapted, and compared three manipulation techniques selected for studying the implications of the design choices.

	abstract = {Commercial 3D scene acquisition systems such as the Microsoft Kinect sensor can reduce the cost barrier of realizing mid-air interaction. However, since it can only sense hand position but not hand orientation robustly, current mid-air interaction methods for 3D virtual object manipulation often require contextual and mode switching to perform translation, rotation, and scaling, thus preventing natural continuous gestural interactions. A novel handle bar metaphor is proposed as an effective visual control metaphor between the user's hand gestures and the corresponding virtual object manipulation operations. It mimics a familiar situation of handling objects that are skewered with a bimanual handle bar. The use of relative 3D motion of the two hands to design the mid-air interaction allows us to provide precise controllability despite the Kinect sensor's low image resolution. A comprehensive repertoire of 3D manipulation operations is proposed to manipulate single objects, perform fast constrained rotation, and pack/align multiple objects along a line. Three user studies were devised to demonstrate the efficacy and intuitiveness of the proposed interaction techniques on different virtual manipulation scenarios.},

Spindle+Wheel takes advantage of greater finger dexterity, the “bandwidth-of-the-fingers” and passive haptics, by using a pair of precision-grasp 6DOF isotonic input devices rather than using either a tracked pair of pinch gloves or a pair of power-grasped 6DOF isotonic input devices. Two user studies were conducted to show that our simultaneous 7DOF interaction technique outperforms a previous two-handed technique as well as a one-handed scene-in-hand technique for a 7DOF travel task.},

	abstract = {A two-handed direct manipulation VE virtual environment interface has been developed as an intuitive manipulation metaphor for graphical objects. A new input device called ChordGloves introduces a simple technique for rapid and repeatable gesture recognition; the Chordgloves emulate a pair of 3-D mice and a keyboard. A drafting table is isomorphically mapped into the VE and provides hand support for 2-D interface techniques, as well as a reference frame for calibrating the mapping between real and virtual worlds. A cursor gravity function is used to grab vertices, edges, or faces and establish precisely aligned differential constraints between objects called anchors. The capability of subjects to translate, rotate, scale, align, and glue objects is tested with a puzzle building task. An approximation of the puzzle task is done in Adobe Illustrator to provide a performance reference. Results and informal user observations as well as topics for future work are presented.},

Our goal is to provide familiar ways for people to conceive, create and manipulate three-dimensional shapes. To this end, we developed on-and-above-the-surface interaction techniques based on asymmetric bimanual interaction for creating and editing 3D models in a stereoscopic environment. Our approach combines both hand and finger tracking in the space on and above a multi-touch surface. This combination brings forth an alternative design environment where users can seamlessly switch between interacting on the surface or above it to leverage the benefit of both interaction spaces. A formal user evaluation conducted with experienced users shows very promising avenues for further work towards providing an alternative to current user interfaces for modeling.},

	abstract = {Multitouch displays represent a promising technology for the display and manipulation of data. While the manipulation of 2D data has been widely explored, 3D manipulation with multitouch displays remains largely unexplored. Based on an analysis of the integration and separation of degrees of freedom, we propose a taxonomy for 3D manipulation techniques with multitouch displays. Using that taxonomy, we introduce Depth-Separated Screen-Space (DS3), a new 3D manipulation technique based on the separation of translation and rotation. In a controlled experiment, we compared DS3 with Sticky Tools and Screen-Space. Results show that separating the control of translation and rotation significantly affects performance for 3D manipulation, with DS3 performing faster than the two other techniques.},
